StatsD 
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DataDog/statsd.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DataDog/statsd)

A fork of etsy's network daemon for aggregating statistics (counters and timers), rolling them up, then sending them to [Datadog][datadog].

Key Concepts
--------

* *buckets*
  Each stat is in its own "bucket". They are not predefined anywhere.

* *values*
  Each stat will have a value. How it is interpreted depends on modifiers. In
general values should be integer.

* *flush*
  After the flush interval timeout (defined by `config.flushInterval`,
  default 10 seconds), stats are aggregated and sent to an upstream backend service.


Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

1. Install node.js
2. Clone the project
3. Create a config file from `exampleConfig.js` and put it somewhere

Then start the daemon:

    node stats.js /path/to/config

Debugging
---------

There are additional config variables available for debugging:

* `debug` - log exceptions and print out more diagnostic info
* `dumpMessages` - print debug info on incoming messages

For more information, check the `exampleConfig.js`.

Supported Backends
------------------

StatsD supports multiple, pluggable, backend modules that can publish
statistics from the local StatsD daemon to a backend service or data
store. Backend services can retain statistics for
longer durations in a time series data store, visualize statistics in
graphs or tables, or generate alerts based on defined thresholds. A
backend can also correlate statistics sent from StatsD daemons running
across multiple hosts in an infrastructure.

This fork specifically implements the Datadog backend. Other backends
are available as well. See the [original documentation](https://github.com/etsy/statsd)
for information about other backends.

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

1. Install node.js
2. Clone the project
3. Create a config file from exampleConfig.js and put it somewhere
4. Get your Datadog API key and generate an app key and stick them into your config file
5. Start the Daemon: `node stats.js /path/to/config`

Tests
-----

A test framework has been added using node-unit and some custom code to start
and manipulate statsd. Please add tests under test/ for any new features or bug
fixes encountered. Testing a live server can be tricky, attempts were made to
eliminate race conditions but it may be possible to encounter a stuck state. If
doing dev work, a `killall statsd` will kill any stray test servers in the
background (don't do this on a production machine!).

Tests can be executed with `./run_tests.sh`.


Meta
---------
- IRC channel: `#datadog` on freenode
